# Private-Messaging-using-MQTT-HiveQT
Send messages to your loved once using this simple Private Messaging technique.

## How it works

We have a publisher who sends the message to the particular topic and subscriber is the one who receives the message.

Publisher -> Topic -> Subscriber

Topic - It's something like the FM frequency where you can subscribe to a topic and listen to all the message sent to that particular topic.
