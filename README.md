## How messaging words with MQTT and HiveQT
## Python has it all

## How it works

We have a publisher who sends the message to the particular topic and subscriber is the one who receives the message.

Publisher -> Topic -> Subscriber

Topic - It's something like the FM frequency where you can turn in to a particular station and listen to all the audio that is broadcasted to that particular topic frequency
